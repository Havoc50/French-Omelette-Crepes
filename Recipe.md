To create tasty french crepes, follow these instructions:

1. Step 1. 
    Set your stove to medium heat and get your ingredients ready.

2. Step 2.
    In a large mixing bowl, add in the milk, water, and eggs. Gradually add the flour, stirring to combine the ingredients. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.

3. Step 3.
    Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup to 1 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly. Make sure that the crepe is nice and thin, so it shouldn't be very thick.

4. Step 4.
    Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.



For omelette crepes, follow these instructions:

1. Get your eggs ready with the salt and optional toppings in a bowl. Make sure the stove is set to a low heat to let the omelette cook.

2. Follow the above instructions up until you pour the crepes onto the pan/griddle. 

3. After the crepe is poured, wait for 20 seconds, then pour the omelette (see below) on top of the crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the omelette coats the crepe's top evenly.

4. Then, you can continue to follow the above recipe.
